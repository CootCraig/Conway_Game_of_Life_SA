      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      Every new generation of Life is determined from the previous generation by three simple rules:
      <ul>
        <li>If an alive cell has two or three alive neighboring cells, it stays alive.</li>
        <li>If a dead cell has exactly three alive neighboring cells, it comes to life.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, the cell will stay dead or die.</li>
      </ul>
      A "neighboring cell" is any of the eight cells adjacent or diagonally adjacent to the given cell.
